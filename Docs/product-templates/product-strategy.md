# Product Strategy Template

**How to define and validate product ideas built on Shell**

Use this template when starting a new product project.

---

## Overview

Building on Shell means you have **architecture solved**.

Now focus on:
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why will they pay?

This template helps answer those questions.

---

## Step 1: Define Core Loop

**What action creates value and drives repeat usage?**

### Example: Rover-style Dog Care
```
Owner adds dog
→ Defines care routine
→ Requests care
→ Trusted sitter accepts
→ Dog is cared for
→ Owner returns for repeat booking
```

### Example: Field Notes App
```
User creates note
→ Adds tags/location
→ Searches later
→ Finds note instantly
→ Creates more notes
```

### Example: Habit Tracker
```
User defines habit
→ Logs daily
→ Sees streak
→ Feels motivated
→ Continues logging
```

**The loop should:**
- Be simple to explain
- Create value on first use
- Encourage repetition
- Build habit over time

**Your Core Loop:**
```

```

## Step 2: Define Your Niche

**Avoid building for "everyone." Find a specific, high-value niche.**

### Strong Niche Characteristics

A good first niche has:

1. **High Urgency**
   - User has a painful problem NOW
   - Can't wait for a solution

2. **High Willingness to Pay**
   - Problem costs time/money/stress
   - Solution provides clear ROI

3. **Repeat Behavior**
   - Not a one-time need
   - Ongoing, recurring use case

4. **Trust-Sensitive**
   - Requires reliability
   - Switching costs are high

5. **Emotional Value**
   - User cares deeply
   - Willing to recommend

### Example: Busy Professional Dog Owners

**Demographics:**
- Age: 28-45
- Income: Mid to high
- Urban/suburban
- Tech-savvy

**Behavior:**
- Travels frequently
- Works long hours
- Has recurring dog care needs
- Uses apps daily

**Pain:**
- Re-explains dog routines repeatedly
- Inconsistent care quality
- Coordination is manual and stressful

**Why this niche:**
- ✅ High urgency (travel/work conflicts)
- ✅ High willingness to pay (convenience premium)
- ✅ Repeat behavior (recurring bookings)
- ✅ Trust-sensitive (their dog's wellbeing)
- ✅ Emotional value (pet care is personal)

### Your Niche

**Demographics:**
```
Age:
Income:
Location:
Tech proficiency:

**Behavior:**

Current habits:
Pain points:

**Why this niche:**
```
High urgency because:
Willingness to pay because:
Repeat behavior because:
Trust-sensitive because:
Emotional value because:
```

## Step 3: Define First User Persona

**Who is the FIRST user you're building for?**

### Template

**Name:** [Give them a name]

**Demographics:**
- Age:
- Income:
- Location:
- Occupation:

**Goals:**
- Primary:
- Secondary:

**Frustrations:**
- With current solutions:
- With alternatives:

**Behavior:**
- Daily habits:
- Tech usage:
- Purchase decisions:

**Pain Statement:**
> "I need [solution] because [pain], and current options fail because [reason]."

### Example: Sarah (Dog Owner)

**Demographics:**
- Age: 34
- Income: $120k
- Location: Urban (NYC)
- Occupation: Product Manager

**Goals:**
- Primary: Consistent, trusted dog care
- Secondary: Less time coordinating care

**Frustrations:**
- Current sitters forget dog routines

- Quality is inconsistent
- Hard to find same sitter

**Behavior:**
- Books care 2-3x per month

- Pays premium for quality

**Pain Statement:**
> "I need someone who knows my dog and follows routines consistently, because I'm tired of re-explaining everything and worrying about quality."

### Your Persona

[Fill in template above]

## Step 4: Differentiation

**What makes your product 10x better than alternatives?**

### Not Good Enough
- "Better UI"
- "Faster"
- "More features"

### Good Differentiation
- "Only app that stores dog routines for continuity of care"
- "Focuses on trusted relationships vs. one-time gigs"
- "Designed for recurring care, not marketplace discovery"

### Example: Rover Clone

**Alternatives:**
- Rover (marketplace, no continuity)
- Local sitters (manual, no tech)

**Differentiation:**
- ✅ Routine-based care (vs. generic bookings)
- ✅ Trusted relationships (vs. one-time gigs)
- ✅ Family coordination (vs. single user)
- ✅ Continuity-focused (vs. discovery-focused)

**Positioning:**
> "Not a dog sitting marketplace. A structured care platform for busy families."

### Your Differentiation

**Alternatives:**
```
1.
2.
3.
```

**How you're 10x better:**
```
Reason 1:
Reason 2:
Reason 3:
```

**Positioning statement:**

## Step 5: MVP Feature Focus

**What MUST be in v1? What can wait?**

### Must-Have (MVP)

Features without which the product has no value.

**Example: Dog Care App**
- Owner accounts
- Dog profiles
- Care routines
- Booking requests
- Basic messaging

### Should-Have (v2)

Features that improve the experience significantly.

**Example:**
- Photo updates
- Activity tracking
- Calendar sync
- Payment processing

### Could-Have (v3+)

Features that are nice but not critical.

**Example:**
- Reviews and ratings
- Marketplace search
- Dynamic pricing
- Recommendations

### Won't Have (Never)

Features that go against core positioning.

**Example:**
- AI matching (too impersonal)
- Auction-style bidding (cheapens service)
- One-time gig discovery (wrong model)

### Your MVP Scope

**Must-Have:**
```
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
```

**Should-Have (v2):**
```
1.
2.
3.
```

**Could-Have (v3+):**
```
1.
2.
```

**Won't Have:**
```
1.
2.
```

## Step 6: Validation Metrics

**How will you know if this is working?**

### Early Validation (First 10 Users)

- Do they complete setup?
- Do they create content (dogs, notes, habits)?
- Do they use the core loop at least once?
- Do they return within 7 days?

### Product-Market Fit Signals (First 100 Users)

- **Retention:** 40%+ weekly active users
- **Repeat usage:** 60%+ complete core loop 2+ times
- **NPS:** 50+ (would they recommend?)
- **Organic growth:** 20%+ come from referrals

### Scale Validation (First 1000 Users)

- **Retention:** 50%+ monthly retention
- **Revenue:** 20%+ convert to paid
- **CAC/LTV:** LTV > 3x CAC
- **Churn:** <5% monthly churn

### Your Validation Plan

**Week 1-2 (First 10 users):**
```
Metric 1:
Metric 2:
Metric 3:
```

**Month 1-3 (First 100 users):**
```
Metric 1:
Metric 2:
Metric 3:
```

**Month 3-6 (First 1000 users):**
```
Metric 1:
Metric 2:
Metric 3:
```

## Step 7: Risk Assessment

**What could kill this product?**

### Common Risks

1. **No real pain**
   - Users don't actually need this
   - Mitigation: Deep user research

2. **Won't pay**
   - Free alternatives are good enough
   - Mitigation: Test pricing early

3. **No retention**
   - One-time use, no habit
   - Mitigation: Design for repeat usage

4. **Competitive moat**
   - Easy to copy
   - Mitigation: Build network effects or data moats

5. **Regulatory/Trust**
   - High barrier to trust
   - Mitigation: Start with trusted networks

### Your Top 3 Risks

**Risk 1:**
