# Context - Product Development Templates

**Reference documentation for building products on Shell**

---

## Purpose

Shell provides **Clean Architecture + MVVM** patterns.

These templates help you **build real-world products** using Shell as your foundation.

---

## Files in This Directory

### Core Workflow
- **[branch-strategy.md](branch-strategy.md)** - Git workflow and branching strategy
- **[workflow-product.md](workflow-product.md)** - How to build features (vertical slices, TDD, MVP)

### Product Strategy
- **[product-strategy.md](product-strategy.md)** - Define niche, persona, differentiation, MVP scope

### Team Growth
- **[team-scaling.md](team-scaling.md)** - Scale from 1 to 15 engineers without slowing down

### Domain Examples
- **[booking-scheduling.md](booking-scheduling.md)** - Build scheduling systems (appointments, bookings)

---

## When to Use These

### Starting a New Product
1. Read [product-strategy.md](product-strategy.md) to define your niche
2. Define MVP scope
3. Use [workflow-product.md](workflow-product.md) for development

### Building Scheduling Features
1. Read [booking-scheduling.md](booking-scheduling.md)
2. Follow MVP approach (simple first)
3. Iterate based on user feedback

### Growing Your Team
1. Read [team-scaling.md](team-scaling.md)
2. Understand scaling stages
3. Hire product engineers first

### Daily Development
1. Use **[PLAYBOOK.md](../PLAYBOOK.md)** for workflow
2. Reference **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** for architecture
3. Use these templates when starting new work

---

## What These Are NOT

❌ **Not mandatory process** - These are templates and references
❌ **Not daily workflow** - Use PLAYBOOK.md for daily work
❌ **Not Shell core docs** - Shell architecture is in CLAUDE.md

✅ **ARE templates** - Examples for building products
✅ **ARE reference** - Consult when needed
✅ **ARE reusable** - Apply to any product on Shell

---

## Philosophy

### Shell = Framework
Clean Architecture + MVVM + Swift 6

### These Templates = Product Guidance
How to build Rover, Field Notes, Habit Tracker, etc. using Shell

### Separation Keeps Shell Reusable
- Shell doesn't care about dogs or bookings
- Your product does
- Templates bridge the gap

---

## Recommended Reading Order

### First Time Building on Shell
1. PLAYBOOK.md (daily workflow)
2. CLAUDE.md (architecture reference)
3. product-strategy.md (define your product)
4. workflow-product.md (build features)

### Starting a Scheduling Product
1. product-strategy.md (define niche)
2. booking-scheduling.md (domain model)
3. workflow-product.md (build MVP)

### Scaling Your Team
1. team-scaling.md (understand stages)
2. Hire product engineers
3. Use vertical ownership model
