- Disk I/O optimization

### Optimization Techniques
- Lazy loading and deferred execution
- Background threading (GCD, OperationQueue)
- Image optimization and caching
- Database query optimization
- Reduce view hierarchy complexity
- Efficient data structures
- Algorithm complexity analysis

### Memory Management
- Identify and fix memory leaks
- Reduce memory footprint
- Optimize image loading
- Manage large datasets
- Cache strategies
- Memory warnings handling

### UI Performance
- 60 FPS rendering
- Reduce overdraw
- Rasterization and shouldRasterize
- Layer optimization
- Smooth scrolling optimization

- Animation performance

### Common Tasks
- Profile and identify bottlenecks
- Fix memory leaks and retain cycles
- Optimize slow methods and algorithms
- Improve app launch time
- Reduce binary size
- Optimize network requests
- Improve scrolling performance
- Reduce battery drain

## Approach
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on user-perceived performance
- Use Instruments to identify issues
- Optimize the critical path first
- Balance performance with code clarity
- Test on real devices
- Monitor metrics over time
- Consider trade-offs (CPU vs memory vs battery)
